      <description>February in Chicago can be less than sunny, although the sun came out today
google analytics seems pretty easy Log in to the google page and create a site google page. Then add the tracking code to the jekyll theme and bam site tracking.
fitbit There has been research done around the accuracy of optical heart rate monitors. I knew they were not accurate up past 150 bpm. This is because the blood is flowing too fast for the sensor to keep up with.</description>

      <description>Productive Saturday rant Been cranking away at my laptop from 630-830 this morning, and realizing that my ancient mac book air battery which was already replace once, is just a poor shadow of what it should be. I&amp;rsquo;m only going to get about 3 hours out of this battery before it dies. Which is sad because i really wanted to get a new laptop this year but mac did not really give us any options.</description>
