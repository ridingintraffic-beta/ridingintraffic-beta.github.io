      <description>I love bagel and egg sandwiches and they are super easy to make with almost no cleanup.
Bagel and egg sandwich the easy way(almost NO cleanup):
as learned from watching a local bagel shop do it for a couple years. heat pan i think its a 12 or 16&amp;quot;, melt butter/oil to coat even nonstick pan while pan is heating take bowl, crack two eggs and whip them together - add whatever spices you want, I usually add nothing once pan is sizzling (if you toss a drop of water in it it sizzles) pour in bowl of eggs toast bagel let cook until it is just about no longer runny, take a decently big spatula fold egg in half, and then fold into quarter, press down, cook one side until it is done enough for you then flip.</description>
