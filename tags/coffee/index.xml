      <description>roast Info using the kill-a-watt attached to the router for exact wattage measurements on my 1200 watt poppery II. full heat is 1000 watts with the heating coils fully isolated. Also there is a basic high temp thermometer that is simply dropped in the top
ambient air temp is 68 degrees with 25% humidity preheat to 275 which is stable heat at 650 watts fan should be run at 100% but can dial down subtly in order to finely adjust the temps |&amp;mdash;+&amp;mdash;+&amp;mdash;|</description>

      <description>docker reboot Every once and a while for prem docker installation a reboot is needed. There are some tools out there that can most likely do this, but today a quick and dirty bash script solved the problem.
Step one dump all the running container IDS, today there were about 23 containers running. docker ps -q &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ids
Next reboot sudo reboot Finally the bash script to quickly spin them all back up.</description>

      <description>Today is the first day I was listening to a podcast today, arrested devops and on it was julia evans she talked about writing a blog post every day about what she learned. Originally this was done for her workshop, in order to keep track of the days and things learned. I feel like it is a good idea so I shall give it a go.
What did I learn? Today I learned about jekyll and hugo.</description>
