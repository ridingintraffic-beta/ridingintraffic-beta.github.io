      <description>ssm rate limiting I was spending a little bit of time trying to scrape some ssm stuff and i figured out that there seems to be a &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; built in to ssm that doesn&amp;rsquo;t let you do too many describes. AWS will complain and say NO BUENO if you do it to often.
aws ssm describe-parameters | jq &amp;#39;.Parameters[]| &amp;#34;\(.Name) \(.Type)&amp;#34;&amp;#39; An error occurred (ThrottlingException) when calling the DescribeParameters operation (reached max retries: 2): Rate exceeded I thought that was kind of a nice thing to stop people from describe everythign too often.</description>

      <description>AWS credential_process There is a setting in the aws config that allows AWS to source the credentials externally. This can be super handy if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to store those as plain text things.
It is called &amp;ldquo;credential process&amp;rdquo;. We can use this in conjunction with native openssl to give you a poor mans encrypted aws keys.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sourcing-external.html
First we will take the aws credentials and dump them to a temp file this is named key.</description>

      <description>Yea it has been a long time since I wrote notes and things but I feel like there are some things to take note on.
EC2 things of interest reading the userdata of an instance There are plenty of times that I need to see what the userdata looks like of my instance. ssh into the box. curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data simple as that
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data #!/bin/bash .... rerunning userdata You should really never rerun userdata but if you are debugging things and need to do things.</description>

      <description>need moar ebs AWS EBS volumes. Yes I know that everything in AWS should be immutable and disposable. But sometimes they aren&amp;rsquo;t. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to go into the philosophical rammifcations of that what we need is a fix. First we find the instance, then the volume, then we grow the volume in aws, then we grow the volume on the box
Lets go and describe the instance
$ aws ec2 describe-instances --filters Name=tag:Name,Values=&amp;#39;MyMagicServer&amp;#39; | jq &amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>ELK There is this thing called elk, and I have no idea how to use it. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know where to being with ELK. I have been using splunk for years, I know how ot do all of this in splunk. But because the data I need is in elk and i cannot easily get it in to splunk I will have to at least start with elk and then go from there.</description>
