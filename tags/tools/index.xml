All you need to do is type the period key and they will pop full fledged web editors for you. with github you are actually getting vscode with gitlab you are getting their editor. this makes me miss github for my daily work environment. but i guess there is a gitlab plugin for vscode in the web.</description>

      <description>Adding code . to your terminal in order to open vscode. I like to maintain a terminal session running with just about everything that I am working on in it. Usually I work in VIM but lately I have needed to use vscode for a number of things. I like being ale to clone or switch the repo I am working on from the terminal and then open an editor directly from there.</description>

      <description>I am borrowing this from pstadler because it is really good https://github.com/pstadler/keybase-gpg-github/blob/master/README.md
Set up Keybase.io, GPG &amp;amp; Git to sign commits on GitHub This is a step-by-step guide on how to create a GPG key on keybase.io, adding it to a local GPG setup and use it with Git and GitHub.
Although this guide was written for macOS, most commands should work in other operating systems as well.
There&amp;rsquo;s a video published by Timothy Miller explaining some parts of this guide.</description>
