      <description>Today is the first day I was listening to a podcast today, arrested devops and on it was julia evans she talked about writing a blog post every day about what she learned. Originally this was done for her workshop, in order to keep track of the days and things learned. I feel like it is a good idea so I shall give it a go.
What did I learn? Today I learned about jekyll and hugo.</description>
