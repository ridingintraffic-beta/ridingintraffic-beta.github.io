      <description>Productive Saturday rant Been cranking away at my laptop from 630-830 this morning, and realizing that my ancient mac book air battery which was already replace once, is just a poor shadow of what it should be. I&amp;rsquo;m only going to get about 3 hours out of this battery before it dies. Which is sad because i really wanted to get a new laptop this year but mac did not really give us any options.</description>

      <description>Today is the first day I was listening to a podcast today, arrested devops and on it was julia evans she talked about writing a blog post every day about what she learned. Originally this was done for her workshop, in order to keep track of the days and things learned. I feel like it is a good idea so I shall give it a go.
What did I learn? Today I learned about jekyll and hugo.</description>
