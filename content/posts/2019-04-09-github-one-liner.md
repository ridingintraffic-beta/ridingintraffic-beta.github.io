# Github releases
There is a nice way to get the latest release from a github repo. as long as it gets tagged as release.
I like to be able to pull down the latest version of a release for specific code in automated builds.
This helps that. 

Use `curl` to get the JSON response for the latest release
Use `grep` to find the line containing file URL
Use `cut` and tr to extract the URL
Use `wget` to download it
```
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/hashcat/hashcat/releases/latest | 
grep "browser_download_url" | 
cut -d : -f 2,3 | 
tr -d \" | 
wget --no-check-certificate -qi -
```

# powershell curl
powershell can call webpages directly and return it much like curl 
```
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/raw/something"Â -SkipCertificateCheck).content | Out-File -FilePath /tmp/something.txt
```
