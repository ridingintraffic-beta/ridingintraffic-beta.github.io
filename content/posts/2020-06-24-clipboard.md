# Iterm Clipboard
Apparently there has been an option sitting in iTerm that will allow applications in the terminal to access the system clipboard and somehow I never knew about this?!?
Inside the preferences-General menu there is a setting called "Selection" and then an option "Applications in terminal may access clipboard"
This is life changing and certainly makes a great many things much much easier
