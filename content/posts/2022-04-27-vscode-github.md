Github and gitlab both have online text editors.    if you are in safari and you have a repo open for either of them.  All you need to do is type the period key and they will pop full fledged web editors for you.   with github you are actually getting vscode with gitlab you are getting their editor.   this makes me miss github for my daily work environment.    but i guess there is a gitlab plugin for vscode in the web.    i guess i will have to play with it a little bit tomrorow and see what is what   cause this is really cool.
