# Splunk and nginx
Doing some splunkjs work from a docker container, and hosting it out of nginx, which means I needed to configure a proxy pass using some load balancing in order to access the splunk cluster, this was a little tricky because of session persistence and https. [nginx load balancing]( http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/load_balancing.html  "nginx load balancing") Luckily there are some good pslunk blogs out there that help out  [configuring-nginx-with-splunk-rest-api-sdk-compatibility](http://blogs.splunk.com/2016/05/25/configuring-nginx-with-splunk-rest-api-sdk-compatibility/ "configuring-nginx-with-splunk-rest-api-sdk-compatibility")  and some good reading about splunkjs read them both [using-the-splunkjs-stack-part-1](http://blogs.splunk.com/2015/09/17/using-the-splunkjs-stack-part-1/ "using-the-splunkjs-stack-part-1")      

# Splunk docker nginx repo
enjoy the repo  and dockerfile check the build.sh and run.sh or just look at the readme [splunkJS-nginx](https://github.com/ridingintraffic/splunkJS-nginx
 "splunkJS-nginx")

# gitignore
I can never remember how to do all the git stuff   here is some gitignore info [gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore "gitignore")  and then using it  [ignoring-files](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ "ignoring-files")

# docker prune
macos and docker get messy after a while.  An error of "no space left on device" will result if you need to clean up,   apparently my cleanup commands were not doing their job or I was missing my volume cleanup. 
```
docker image prune
docker container prune
docker network prune
docker volume prune 

nuclear option
docker system prune  (does them all)
```
