# pathogen vim
whne I reinstalled everything on my laptop i forgot to install pathogen for vim.  and as a result.  all of my conf files from the dotfile repo stopped working right in vim :(
good to keep track of this repo https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
and then the command to support it: 

```mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle && \
curl -LSso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://tpo.pe/pathogen.vim```
