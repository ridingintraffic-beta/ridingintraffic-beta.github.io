# Friday
Running rspec tests in jenkinsfiles today. It actually went prett easy...   Build the docker images and then inside of it fire the docker run command for rspec and the exit code is caught from the sh in the jenkins step.

# Gitmask
coding without a trace...   this looks kind of fun to make commits and whatnot but do it so no one knows who it is or where it came from... Just think of all the fun things that can be done with this...
