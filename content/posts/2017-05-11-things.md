# Git all the things
Git is fantastic and I try to use it wherever I can. 
However outside of git, source control is a must. If a system does not support source control or version-ing then you need to make something that does.  F5 does not do an elegant source control. So, I wrote an interface for the rest API that run every hour in Jenkins. It downloads the irule data then adds it to git. This has saved my ass a few times now. Accidents happen and just being able to do side by side diffs on files makes debugging a giant sized easier.
