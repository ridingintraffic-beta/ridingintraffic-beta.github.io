# bullet journal conversion
I have been using bullet journal for a time now and finding that the paper notebook is difficult for my lifestyle and for at work where I spend my life on the computer and I just donâ€™t want to have to carry the notebook and my laptop with me every time. I understand that part of the concept of the bujo is to physically write things.  However this is a difficult task when I carry my laptop around with me everywhere I go. It was not feasible to always carry a notebook and a laptop and my waterbottle whenever I would attend meetings.  For a while i left he notebook behind and would add reminders and then transcribe them.  However this fell off as I would again not have my notebook when I would have transcription time.  Instead I have decided that a good option is to follow the same bujo rules of rewriting tasks per day and simply doing a digital version of a bujo in evernote. 

# negation logic 
If and not(this or that) is hard and makes my brain hurt a bit.  Writing if not and/or logic gets very confusing very fast, discrete logic for the win.
