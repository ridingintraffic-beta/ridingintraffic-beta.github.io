# UNI
there is a handy little thing written in go that can handle unicode lookups from the terminal.   I like all things terminal so here it is.  
https://github.com/arp242/uni  
```go get arp242.net/uni```   
Which will then allow you to search unicode from the terminal nice and easy `uni search unicorn`  

# headset control
I use an arctis 7 for my work headset,  it is pretty nice but since it is USB 2.4ghz it lacks some of the features up bluetooth.  
One such feature is battery % in the taskbar.   
This can be fixed by using a terminal app called "headsetcontrol" and combining it with my bitbar.  https://github.com/Sapd/HeadsetControl
Then add this script to the bitbar script folder.  
```
#!/bin/bash
#headset.15m.sh

HEADSET_BATTERY=$(/usr/local/bin/headsetcontrol -b -c)
echo "ðŸŽ§:$HEADSET_BATTERY%"
```
Bitbar has no issues with the unicode for heaphones, it will output a nice cute little headphone icon.   
A bonus option of this is turning on the feature in the headset to dump your audio to the headset as well.
This help modulate your voice level and or hear your surroundings if that is something that you want 
`headsetcontrol -s 64` will give you 50% of the total mix.  
```
