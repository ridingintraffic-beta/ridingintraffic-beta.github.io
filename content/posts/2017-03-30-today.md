# vagrant
vagrant is a useful tool for demoing and discovery work when you don't want to go about standing up everything 
```
vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64
vagrant up - starts up the vagrant image that has a vagrant file in the working directory
vagrant status - checking status of vagrant
vagrant ssh   to log in to the machine that is already running
cat /etc/issue
vagrant destroy - tears it all down
vagrant halt _ stop without teardown
which <command>    - shows you were that commmand lives
```

# ansible 
ansible inventory 
```
host[1:3].example.com is the same as
host1.example.com
host2.example.com
host3.example.com
```
