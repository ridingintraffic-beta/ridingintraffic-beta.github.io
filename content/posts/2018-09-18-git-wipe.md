# removing git history
sometimes you jsut want to wipe everything from a git repo but you want to hold on to the files.

We can do this by following this pattern:

-- Remove history 
rm -rf .git

-- recreate the repos from the current content only
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

-- push to the github remote repos ensuring you overwrite history
git remote add origin git@github.com:<YOUR ACCOUNT>/<YOUR REPOS>.git
git push -u --force origin master
