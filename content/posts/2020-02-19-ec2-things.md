Yea it has been a long time since I wrote notes and things but I feel like there are some things to take note on.  

# EC2 things of interest
## reading the userdata of an instance   
There are plenty of times that I need to see what the userdata looks like of my instance.
ssh into the box.
`curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data`  simple as that
```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
#!/bin/bash
....
```
## rerunning userdata  
You should really never rerun userdata but if you are debugging things and need to do things.
but if you want to do something terrible.  
```
curl -sSL http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data | bash
```
