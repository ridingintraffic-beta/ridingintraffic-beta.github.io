I acquired a bsh bunny yesterday and we will see what I can figure out with it.

# bash bunny
yes the bash bunny is pretty simple to use.  It is a full mini linux computer that runs on an arm7 chip with a good amount of on board storage and ram.   I was able to pull down the repo from bunny payloads and do a quick nmap of my machine.  payload git repo: [https://github.com/hak5/bashbunny-payloads ](https://github.com/hak5/bashbunny-payloads  "https://github.com/hak5/bashbunny-payloads ")
 


# docker swarm
I had a bit of time to sit down and try my hand at connecting to our swarm cluster and firing up som eservices. I kind of sorta understand what I was doing but I had someone holding my hand through it.  This will take a few more times beofre I actually figure it out. 

# kibana
I also spent another painful 30 minutes with kibana.  I think if I really ever need to learn this it will take some time to unlearn how i know how to do things in splunk and just start from square one in kibana.
