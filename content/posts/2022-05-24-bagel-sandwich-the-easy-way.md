I love bagel and egg sandwiches and they are super easy to  make with almost no cleanup.  
Bagel and egg sandwich the easy way(almost NO cleanup):  
- as learned from watching a local bagel shop do it for a couple years.  
1. heat pan i think its a 12 or 16", melt butter/oil to coat even nonstick pan  
2. while pan is heating take bowl, crack two eggs and whip them together - add whatever spices you want, I usually add nothing  
3. once pan is sizzling (if you toss a drop of water in it it sizzles) pour in bowl of eggs  
4. toast bagel  
5. let cook until it is just about no longer runny,   take a decently big spatula fold egg in half, and then fold into quarter, press down, cook one side until it is done enough for you then flip.  
6. once flipped add the cheese of your choice until melted then transfer to bagel as the bagel should now be done toasting and hot.  
7. using the same pan add the meat of choice if thats your jam, ham/peperoni works well.  
8. heat, transfer, eat,  profit  
Cooking this meal this way will mean that the messiest cleanup will be the bowl that you mixed the eggs in.  The pan, once oiled/buttered should leave almost nothing behind, unlike scrambled eggs which are a nightmare to clean up.   
Enjoy!!
