# VIM
I am still trying to force feed myself vim. As a part of that effort I have included this in my vimrc   ```noremap  <Up> ""
noremap! <Up> <Esc>
noremap  <Down> ""
noremap! <Down> <Esc>
noremap  <Left> ""
noremap! <Left> <Esc>
noremap  <Right> ""
noremap! <Right> <Esc>
```  
which should turn off all of my arrow keys and force me to navigate the world with vim arrows at least while in vim. 
This is all in an effort to try and get myself to get better at vim.  Why vim do you ask?  Because it is lightweight installed everywhere and the better that you are with your tools the better you can not let your tools liomit you.  There is a book called the pragmatic programmer that speaks to this idea.  It is the idea that the tool should not limit what you can do.  A tool like vim has the ability to pretty much do anything.  It is just a matter of you learning how to use that tool to the best of your ability.  If you can stick to a single tool then the majority of your time will be devoted to becoming really good at jsut that tool.  That is my intent in force feeding myself vim.  Perhaps this time I will actually spend enough time with vim to make it stick.
