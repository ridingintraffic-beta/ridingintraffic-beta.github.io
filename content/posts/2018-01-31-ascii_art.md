# macro-ing ergodox
There is a firmware out there called qmk.  QMK is awesome and you can program your custom keyboards to do just about anythin.   I wanted to write a macro for `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` because I got sidetracked and went down the rabbit hole.  
The tricky part is sending the hex codes through to the OS.  This is first done in the keyboard and then you need to setup MACos to have the input source of Unicode Hex input, otherwise it is not going to get converted properly.

There is some documentation for qmk and the macro options here [feature_macros.html](https://docs.qmk.fm/feature_macros.html "feature_macros.html")
The final product can be found here because why not just include the final
my keymap
[keymap.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ridingintraffic/qmk_firmware/master/keyboards/ergodox_ez/keymaps/fettis/keymap.c "keymap.c")
