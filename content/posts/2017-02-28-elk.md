# ELK #
There is this thing called elk,  and I have no idea how to use it. 
I don't even know where to being with ELK.  I have been using splunk for years, I know how ot do all of this in splunk. But because the data I need is in elk and i cannot easily get it in to splunk I will have to at least start with elk and then go from there.  I have started reading some of this [complete-guide-elk-stack](http://logz.io/learn/complete-guide-elk-stack/ "complete-guide-elk-stack")
  but my attention span is failing for today. 

# AWS east s3
Today aws s3 decided to crap itself,  that was fun.  Luckily no too much of my stuff was running there so I wasn't directly influenced by it.  However there were plenty of people on fire about it.

# Proxpn
I have a lifetime membership to proxpn. [proxpn](https://secure.proxpn.com/ "proxpn")   They have a pretty good iOS and android application.  I needed to access their network via openvpn because the ciphers and protections around openvpn are better than pptp for many reasons. There is a nice little bash utlity that handles some basic connection strings and running the openvpn client [proxpn-bash-client](https://github.com/MattSurabian/proxpn-bash-client.git "proxpn-bash-client")  If you would rather just have at it from the config files there is this repo instead.
