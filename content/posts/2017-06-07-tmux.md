# sublime from the terminal
I live in a terminal but I am not great at vim yet so lets embed sublime instead of vim...

`ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/sublime`

this creates a symlink for the sublime cli command so you can run 

sublime filename (replace "filename" by an actual file name)
or
sublime foldername (replace "foldername" by an actual folder name)
or even
sublime . (to open the entire current directory)

# ranger
I guess that I never talked about ranger before
ranger is a file vrowser and previewer that lets you quickly see file contents from the browser and then dive right in to vim from their.

# grep trick of the day
Lets find just symlinks in a folder  because sometimes you have a bunch of files in there and finding only symlinks is a pain.
`ls -lA | grep -e "->"`

# routing proxies
The concept of a routing proxy is kind of like a load balncer but it is much more complicated there are a couple different routing proxies that are gaining traction
