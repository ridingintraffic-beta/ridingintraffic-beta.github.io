# bash ssh keys
Good to remember if you have ssh keys setup the `.ssh` folder is `700` and the `authorized_keys` file is `644`
> SSH keys are a public and private key that you store on a host that you are going to ssh in to.  This key allwos fo r aecure login without having to relay a password through the terminal.  It is a more secure form of authentication that the basic username and password. Also it is good for scripts to use this because you doesn't require interaction from the keyboard to get from one box to the other.
