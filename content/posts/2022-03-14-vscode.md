Adding `code .` to your terminal in order to open vscode.
I like to maintain a terminal session running with just about everything that I am working on in it.  Usually I work in VIM but lately I have needed to use vscode for a number of things.  I like being ale to clone or switch the repo I am working on from the terminal and then open an editor directly from there.  This can be accomplish in vscode through a simple confguration addition. 
```
With VS Code running, enter Command + Shift + P to open the Command Palette (or View > Command Palette from the menu bar)
A search bar will open up. Search for “Shell” or “Shell Command” and you should see one named Shell Command: install "code" command in PATH.
```
Once that is done then its a simple `code .` and a new vscode window will open with the folder contents in it.   

Thanks for the tip shannon.  [install code to path](https://shannoncrabill.com/blog/shell-command-open-directory-in-vscode/)
