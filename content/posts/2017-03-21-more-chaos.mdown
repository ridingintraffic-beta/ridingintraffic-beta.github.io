# dogs

ADD took its toll and I wandered down this rabbit hole, pparently the dog greeting stretch is a thing. 
>The Greeting Stretch is a posture used only towards someone the dog likes and with whom he is comfortable. There is also a version of this where the dog leans forward and stretches his rear legs out behind him. In the greeting stretch, you will see a relaxed ear carriage and squinty eyes. The dogs have a liquid, languid look about them. â€œIt is very flattering to have a dog greet you in this unrestrained, friendly and very respectful manner. This greeting acknowledges your personal space and is a request for the two of you to interact.
