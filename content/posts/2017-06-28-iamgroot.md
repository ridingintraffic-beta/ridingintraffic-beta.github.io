# changing root username to groot
First things first, if you are going to do this you should have a root shell already open.   If you do any of these commands as sudo, odds are good it won't work.

Honestly who doesn't want to see all of the old files owned by root suddenly become owned by groot?!?!  This has got to be the best worst idea I have had in a while.  

I changed the account name in /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group, and /etc/gshadow and /etc/sudoers. Then grepped for the name root in /etc/   `grep -r "root" /etc/ "`


Then you can also create an alias in your .bashrc file that contains
alias iamgroot=’sudo su - groot’

There is plenty of discusssion around this being a bad idea but who cares.  I have an extra box laying around that I will turn in to my groot box.
