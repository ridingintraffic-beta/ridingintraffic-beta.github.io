# git gc
`git gc ..` while useful can be pretty nasty.  Make sure that you don't do a `git gc --prune=now` unless you really want to clean out your repos.
[git gc](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/ "git gc")
Runs a number of housekeeping tasks within the current repository, such as compressing file revisions (to reduce disk space and increase performance) and removing unreachable objects which may have been created from prior invocations of git add.
