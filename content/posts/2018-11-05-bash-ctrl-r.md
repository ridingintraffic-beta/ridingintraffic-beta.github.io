# Bash ctrl+r 
Bash has a special “recall” mode you can use to search for commands you’ve previously run:

Ctrl+R: Recall the last command matching the characters you provide. Press this shortcut and start typing to search your bash history for a command.
Ctrl+O: Run a command you found with Ctrl+R.
Ctrl+G: Leave history searching mode without running a command.
