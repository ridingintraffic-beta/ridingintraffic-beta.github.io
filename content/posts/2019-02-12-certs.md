# self signed certs
Genning certs is always a pita, luckily I found a quick and easy way from the folks over at spiderlabs, to do it..
[gen-self-signed-cert.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpiderLabs/Responder/master/certs/gen-self-signed-cert.sh "gen-self-signed-cert.sh")
```
#!/bin/bash
openssl genrsa -out my.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key my.key -out my.crt -subj "/"
```
