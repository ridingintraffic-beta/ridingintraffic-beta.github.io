Using repl to debug python.  
[https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/09/16/debugging-in-a-repl-is-fun/](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/09/16/debugging-in-a-repl-is-fun/)
``` 
what’s a REPL?

REPL stands for “read eval print loop”. A REPL is a program that:

    reads some input from you like print(f"2 + 2 = {2+2}") (read)
    evaluates the input (eval)
    print out the result (print)
    and then goes back to step 1 (loop)
```
A couple years ago I used pry in ruby/chef a bunch and then I guess I forgot about it.  Now this works for python too and it is WAY better than my `print` statement hell that I usually write.  
Needless to say all you need to do in python is drop this one line in where you want to break and wam bam.   
```import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()```
and then you get access to a REPL and you can interogate all your variables and write functions and whatever you want.  
So simple, so clean.  
Let's hope I don't forget about it again.
