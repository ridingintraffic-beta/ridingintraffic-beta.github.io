# guard clauses 
Because I did not know the term for this,  a guard clause is essentially a check `if not null` or similar empty set checks in code... example for ruby is 
```return [] if instances.empty?```   Filling in holes of knowledge and writing them down becaue otherwise I may not retain them.
