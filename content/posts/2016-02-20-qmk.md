## docker images
qmk builder can be done via docker.  This means that it is way easier to build than dealing with all the dependencies for building, just use docker.
 ```
 docker run -e keymap=default_modded -e keyboard=ergodox_ez --rm -v $('pwd'):/qmk:rw edasque/qmk_firmware
 docker run -e keymap=ridingintraffic -e keyboard=ergodox_ez --rm -v $('pwd'):/qmk:rw edasque/qmk_firmware
 docker run -e keymap=ridingintraffic -e keyboard=planck/rev4 --rm -v $('pwd'):/qmk:rw edasque/qmk_firmware
```
