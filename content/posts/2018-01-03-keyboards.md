# Macbook pro keyboard
The macbook pro keyboard is terrible.  I have a whole bunch of differnt mechanical keyboards.  There are times  however that resting a mechnical keyboard on the top of the existing keyboard would be nice.   This creates an issue where keys will get pressed on the built in keyboard.  The solution for this is to install kayabiner elements.  Then there is an option in the preferences named devices and an option to disable the existing keyboard if certain usb keyboards are plugged in.  First have that menu open with no keyboard plugged in and then insert the usb an see what the keyboard hardware id reports as.  Then it is as easy as selecting the checkbox and the built in keyboard is disabled.  It is then enabled as soon as you unplug the usb.  This is a fantastic little feature.
