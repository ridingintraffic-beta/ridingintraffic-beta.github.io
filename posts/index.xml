      <description>player 2(040) has entered the game. During the past 2 years if you had not noticed, there has been a chip shortage. Namely the atmega 32u4 chips that power the elite-c and pro micros microcontrollers that are at the centers of custom keyboards. It just so happened that during this time raspberry pi developed a microcontroller of their own.
This is known as the rp2040.
rp2040
Why does this matter? Well we can now get the 2040 as a drop in replacement for the pro micros.</description>
